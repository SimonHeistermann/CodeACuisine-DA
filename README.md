# 🍳 Code à Cuisine

Your ingredients → our AI → your next meal.
A smart, fast, and playful cooking experience powered by Angular, Firebase, and an AI recipe generator.

Code à Cuisine is an interactive web app that turns your available ingredients into three instantly cookable recipes—generated by an AI-powered workflow in n8n.

## Each generated recipe includes:

- A complete ingredient list

- Clear step-by-step directions

- Cooking roles (“Chef 1”, “Chef 2”, …)

- Cooking time, cuisine & diet preferences

- Nutritional information

- A deterministic recipe signature (deduplication)

- Favorites / Likes

- Automatic Firestore persistence

The app also provides a Cookbook where users can browse all saved recipes, sorted by likes and filtered by cuisine.

## 🚀 Features

### 🔥 1. AI Recipe Generation (n8n + LLM)

- Users enter ingredients and cooking preferences

- Angular triggers a webhook → n8n → LLM

- AI returns a validated recipe data structure

- App displays results AND auto-saves them to Firestore

- Duplicate recipes are detected through a generated signature

### 📚 2. Cookbook (Firestore Database)

All recipes—generated or liked—are stored in Firestore under a single consistent structure.

#### The cookbook includes:

- Cuisine filtering

- Sorting by popularity

- Pagination (15 recipes per page)

- Firestore-ID based navigation

- Unified detail pages for generated & stored recipes

### ❤️ 3. Favorites / Likes System

#### A hybrid storage strategy:

- LocalStorage → remembers what you liked

- Firestore → stores global like counters

- Live UI updates on click

- Safe decrement logic (never below 0)

### 🔍 4. Recipe Detail View

#### Each recipe detail page shows:

- Title, cooking time, cuisine

- Number of cooks & chef badges

- Ingredient lists with formatted units

- Full directions with chef role indicators

- Nutritional information

- A favorite button (active/hover/click states)

- A CTA to generate new recipes

### 🎨 5. Modern UI & UX

- Fully responsive

- Custom design system (colors, badges, fonts, shadows)

- Standalone Angular components

- SCSS with structured BEM naming

##  ⚙️ Setup & Development
1. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

2. Configure environments

/src/environments/environment.ts
```bash
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  webhookUrl: 'http://localhost:5678/webhook-test/generate-recipe',
  firebase: {
    apiKey: '...',
    authDomain: '...',
    projectId: '...',
    storageBucket: '...',
    messagingSenderId: '...',
    appId: '...',
    measurementId: '...'
  }
};
```

3. Start Development Server
```bash
ng serve
```

Available at:
➡️ http://localhost:4200

Angular automatically reloads on file changes.

4. Build for Production
```bash
ng build
```

Output will be inside:

```bash
dist/code-a-cuisine/
```

## 🧪 Testing
Unit Tests
